# Welcome! I am Bevo XV. 
  
</br>

##### I weigh almost one ton and my horns are ~5 feet long from tip to tip.

##### I enjoy football and chewing on various grasses. 

##### I do not like the UGA Bulldog and I do not hold any advanced degrees.  

##### I don't have any data-related projects either, but if I did you could find them [here](/portfolio)!
